\begin{itemize}
    \item Present the results of your model's performance compared to the baseline.
    \item Use tables and figures to illustrate key findings.
    \item Discuss the significance of your results in the context of the problem.
\end{itemize}

The model's performance was evaluated using the MAE, MAPE and RMSE metrics.
The table~\ref{tab:model_performance_comparison} shows a comparison between our model and the DCRNN baseline.
The horizon is set to 1 hour (12 time steps).

NOTE: further experiments are in progress to get better comparisons to the baseline, like using other metrics and other horizons.
