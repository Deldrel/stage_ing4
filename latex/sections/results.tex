The model's performance was evaluated using the MAE and RMSE metrics.
Table~\ref{tab:model_performance_comparison} shows a comparison between our model and the DCRNN baseline.
The horizon is set to 1 hour (12 time steps).

NOTE: further experiments are in progress to get better comparisons to the baseline, like using other metrics and other horizons.
